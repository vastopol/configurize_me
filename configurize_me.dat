have one big shell script which executes smaller scripts
will need already installed as prerequesites:
* bash
* apt

1. checker script
    - run sanity check if apt installed, if not exit
    - if needed install git, -python-pip, python3-pip3   
    - run apt-get upgrade && apt-get update
2. apt script
    - have it read from a special file _apt_install
    - file will specify packages to install separated by newlines
    - goes through the list installs the packages
    - collect and report statistics on the inatallation
3. pip
4. pip3
5. git
    - set global push, global name, global email, etc...
    - install git repos specified, use git clone


most likely will use shell scripting
can check if things exist by checking with "which PRGM_NAME" just variable swap for each name in list.
