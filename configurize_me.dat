have one big shell script which executes smaller scripts
will need already installed as prerequesites:
* bash
* apt

1. bashrc script
    - add user aliases
    - add user functions
2. apt script
    - if needed install git, python-pip, python3-pip
    - have it read from a requirements file with packages listed
    - goes through the list installs the packages
    - collect and report statistics on the installation (maybe)
3. pip && pip3
    - install packages with requirements file
4. git
    - set global push, global name, global email, etc...
    - install git repos specified, using git clone

--------------------

using pip/pip3 can have a preconfigured requirements file
    "pip install -r requirements.txt"

--------------------

probably not a good way to check if exists... fix later

can check if things are installed by checking with "which PRGM_NAME" just variable swap for each name in list.

EXISTS1=$(eval "which git")

if   [ $EXISTS1 != "/usr/bin/git" ] ; then
    echo "ERROR: package 'git' not installed"
    exit 1
fi
