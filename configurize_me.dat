have one big shell script which executes smaller scripts
will need already installed as prerequesites:
* bash
* apt

1. bashrc script
    - add user aliases
    - add user functions
2. apt script
    - if needed install git, python-pip, python3-pip
    - have it read from a requirements file with packages listed
    - goes through the list installs the packages
    - collect and report statistics on the installation (maybe)
    - note: it is important that the apt_list.txt ends with new line at bottom or last package might not get read in
3. pip && pip3
    - install packages with requirements file
4. git
    - set global push, global name, global email, etc...
    - install git repos specified, using git clone

--------------------

using pip/pip3 can have a preconfigured requirements file
    "pip install -r requirements.txt"
