# configurize_me

a tool for automated setup and installation customization

the idea is to run 1 script after a new ubuntu or debian install and it will setup my computer for me
the scripts and files should all be very modular if anyone else wants to use them they just change very little

## Tasks
* perform updates and upgrades
* add aliases and functions to the .bashrc file
* install packages with apt, pip, pip3
* setup git configuration and clone repositories

## Requirements
* bash
* apt
* apt-get
* apt-cache
