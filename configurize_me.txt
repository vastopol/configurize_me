have one big shell script which executes smaller scripts
will need already installed as prerequesites:
* bash
* apt

1. bashrc script
    - add user aliases
    - add user functions
2. apt scripts
    - update, upgrade, etc...
    - if needed install git, python-pip, python3-pip
    - have it read from a requirements file with packages listed
    - goes through the list installs the packages
    - collect and report statistics on the installation (maybe)
3. pip && pip3
    - install packages with requirements file
    - using pip/pip3 can have a preconfigured requirements file
        "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. git
    - set global: name, email, push, editor
    - clone specified git repositories
5. atom apm
    - download community packages
6. Release upgrade for Ubuntu
    - enable "do-release-upgrade"

note: it is important that requirements.txt ends with new line at bottom or last package might not get read in

----------------------------------------

todo:

edit requirements files
    - apt, pip, git, apm, ...

alias terminatrix="terminator & exit"
